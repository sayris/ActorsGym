								<b>At The Actors Gymnasium, students learn to fly - physically, emotionally, and creatively.</b>  Our unique workshops engage students, providing them with a foundation in circus arts and physical theater, while simultaneously expanding their abilities to cooperate with classmates, create routines using their newfound skills, and perform confidently in front of their peers and teachers. <br><br>
								
								With over 18 years of experience providing premiere instruction and entertainment to the Chicagoland area, we have an unparalleled track record of robust and sequential services for pre-k through 12th grade students.  Our educational workshops operate in a number of school districts, including Districts 36, 39, 65, 202, and 205, teaching students of all ages a variety of skills based on the numerous classes we offer. <br><br>
								
								Having been vetted by a team of evaluators at CPS Central Office, we are now included in Board Report 13-250080, giving clearance to pre-negotiate in-school arts education services without requiring further approval beyond a task order.  We have been selected as highly qualified for Artist Residencies, Performance & Assemblies, and Exhibitions & Productions.  We would love the opportunity to work with you to develop an enriching arts program for your students.  You can see a more detailed overview of our offerings by following this

								Incorporating aspects of dance, tumbling, physical theater, and story telling, Circus acts as a unique medium through which participants are able to express themselves both physically and emotionally.  Beyond its artistic merit and ability to cross cultural and lingual barriers, Circus Arts is physically rigorous - participants build strength, flexibility, and coordination simply through the basic skills practiced every week in class.  Furthermore, Circus is engaging, able to capture the attention of all ages through the large scope of skills and spectacles it encompasses - everyone is able to find a skill they excel in, and thus everyone is able to reap the innumerable rewards found in skill play and participating in the creative world of Circus Arts.

										Led by experienced teaching artists, The Actors Gymnasium residencies and workshops provide a framework for students to create, cooperate and perform while learning new skills, build social and emotional learning, exploring various subjects, and expanding their creative expressions.  Residencies range from six weeks to full year long programming; we find that outcomes are best achieved with a minimum of one class per week.  Further we can cater the class to focus on any specific skill or subject matter desired (e.g. history, mythology, etc.)

										The Actors Gymnasium's dynamic shows run anywhere from 20 - 90 minutes in length.  We are able to provide a pre-devised show, or create a custom piece to your specifications if desired.  We also have dedicated Ground Acts (3 - 7 minutes of artfully choreographed juggling, hand balancing, unicycling, and more) and Aerial Arts (3 - 7 minutes of crowd dazzling Lyra, Silks, Trapeze, and more.  Please see additional note for aerial rigging).  Lastly we offer a plethora of environmental performers, able to interact with students and mingle with large crowds.									</td>

										The Actors Gymnasium's versatile creative staff can enhance any school production experience.  We are able to provide Circus/Dance Choreographers, Directors, Writers, and Designers to augment or develop new or existing work.  We most commonly assist with stage combat, stilt-walking, juggling and aerial arts. This year, we are proud to be working on <i>Pippin</i> with IHSA this year. Other projects include: choreography for three teenage aerialists for a high school production of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and beginner movement workshops for 44 High School students in preparation for <i>Tarzan</i>. The sky's the limit - literally!
