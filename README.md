# ActorsGym
While interning at The Actors Gymnasium (Summer 2014), I created two emails to be sent out via Constant Contact <br>
<ul>
  <li>CPAC (Circus and Performing Arts Camp) Email 
    <ul><li>With the newfound arts requirement in all Chicago Public Schools, The Actors Gym wanted to reach 
    out to numerous CPS principals and arts liaisons in hopes of being hired to teach private workshops for 
    students of that school.</li>
    <li>I drafted this first version of the email, however my internship 
    finished before I could see this project come to fruition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Birthday Email </li>
  <ul><li>This email is sent out to registered adult students in their birthday month.
  
  
  </li>
  
  
  </ul>
